**Very pleased to post a link to interim data being shown at the BSG annual conference 2020**

Title *Investigating clonal expansions in the normal stomach and the 3D architecture of oxyntic gastric glands.*

Due to be presented at the British Society of Gastroenterology 2020 (postponed to 2021)
Live Q&A will be at:
5:00 PM - 6:00 PM, Wednesday January 27th 2021.

In this work we study genetic mutations occurring in normal gastric tissue. We characterise clonal expansions and how this is influenced by chronic inflammation.
We also showcase results from a novel tissue 3D reconstruction technique developed in the Jansen lab group.  In these examples we show how individual clonal lineages can be traced in 3D within the gastric glands they have originated.
